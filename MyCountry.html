        <p>I was born and raised in the Hub of Africa, Ethiopia. This is the only African country that has never been colonized. <br>
           The people are proud of thier culture. The country has its own calendar. For your information, it is now 2014 in Ethiopian calendar. <br>
           There are more than 80 different languages. This country is the only African country that has its own alphablet. It also has 13 months of sunshine. <br><a href=""></a>
           Finally, I would like to mention that Ethiopia is sometimes reffered to as "The Cradle of Mankind" <br>
           as the olderst and relatively complete human fossil called "Lucy" Was found in this country. <br>
           There are planty of amazing facts about Ethiopia; please visit this old and historically rich country with me.

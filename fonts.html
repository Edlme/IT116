            <p>Jean-Michel Basquiat started as a street artist writing graffiti as SAMO, then became immersed in <br>
               the Downtown art and music scene. He was in an experimental band called Gray, but he was also connected<br>
               to the emerging Hip-Hop movement.[1] Basquiat was friends with graffiti artists such as Fab 5 Freddy, Toxic<br>
               and Ramellzee. In 1983, Basquiat produced the hip-hop single "Beat Bop" by Rammellzee and K-Rob, and he <br>
               created the cover art.[2] Ramellzee and Toxic accompanied Basquiat to Venice, Los Angeles while he prepared <br>
               for his March 1983 show, his second at the Gagosian Gallery in West Hollywood.[3] While in Los Angeles, the <br>
               trio called themselves "The Hollywood Africans" as social statement to counter the stereotypical portrayals of<br>
               African Americans in Hollywood.[4] During this trip, Basquiat painted Hollywood Africans, which questions the<br>
               depictions of African Americans in film, particularly during the Golden Age of Hollywood.</p>
